    <h1>Spatial Language Model (LM) Behavior</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Spatial Language Models process and understand spatial relationships and geometric information in text and visual contexts.</p>

        <h2>Key Behaviors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>SpatialLM is a 3D large language model designed to process 3D point cloud data and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs. These outputs include architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object bounding boxes with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods that require specialized equipment for data collection, SpatialLM can handle point clouds from diverse sources such as monocular video sequences, RGBD images, and LiDAR sensors. This multimodal architecture effectively bridges the gap between unstructured 3D geometric data and structured 3D representations, offering high-level semantic understanding. It enhances spatial reasoning capabilities for applications in embodied robotics, autonomous navigation, and other complex 3D scene analysis tasks.

            <li><strong>Positional Awareness:</strong> Understands relative positions (left, right, above, below)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance Estimation:</strong> Estimates spatial distances between objects</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Processes directional instructions and path planning</li>
            <li><strong>Scene Understanding:</strong> Interprets complex spatial layouts and compositions</li>
        </ul>
